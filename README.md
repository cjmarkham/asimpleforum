Testing

A Simple Forum uses GruntJS to detect errors within Javascript files. Simply install Grunt through NPM using:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    
Or you can cd into the root directory of the forum and run

        npm install
    
Now you can run the watch task from the command line to automatically watch JS files for changes.

    grunt watch
